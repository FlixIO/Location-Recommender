AMSTERDAM: zondag 15 januari 2012 arrowhead live, rockconcert!
BARCELONA: esportiu rocafort was a little chaotic. there were several staff present that were a delight. if you&#39;d like to simply stop in for a work out (say on business travel) -- forget it. they won&#39;t let you in -- and they won&#39;t recommend other places in town. as a matter of fact the two people at the reception desk on the evening of june 19 2012 --told me that barcelona did not have any other health clubs as recommendations to me. after i left this place, i saw a group of 5-6 people walking the streets with some work out mats, so i followed them. they took me to cem can ricart -- a health club/gym which had a ymca type atmosphere..with children playing and a family-style environment. they were very welcoming and allowed you to pay per individual class. they have a plethora of classes offered. there is also a spa across the way -- and outdoor seats for relaxing/taking a snack. i&#39;d recommend you don&#39;t go to esportiu rocafort.
BERLIN: NaN
DUBAI: great to take a night time swim - open until 10pm
LONDON: this is well worth a visit if your in the area. the museum is a hidden treasure in south london, which most tourists will miss. over recent years the museum has had lots of money invested in bringing it up to date as it used to be very old and dusty which was part of its charm. now however the whole experience is more interactive and awe inspiring for adults as well as children. the gardens are lovely to stroll around with well kept areas and a animal zone that children will love to see.
PARIS: nice food, decent service, original interior and live music make it a great place! will definitely come back!
